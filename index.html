	<h2>Bridging the Gap Between Science and Software to Optimize Processes</h2>
	<p>I have a background in Engineering Physics from Colorado School of Mines. I chose to study physics because I am driven to understand the root cause and underlying phenomena to make informed decisions about how and why things behave in unique ways. To me, deeply understanding how and why something works gives engineers a better leverage to apply those concepts to optimize processes or to better identify why something isnâ€™t working and debug. While studying physics, I have been able to apply and improve my problem solving skills to various hands-on and research projects at Mines. In addition to my project experience at Mines, I was also able to apply my passion for optical systems and problem solving through an internship at Texas Instruments. I worked in their semiconductor manufacturing as a Photolithography Process Engineer Intern, where I was able to work on three projects simultaneously to optimize and improve the photolithography processes.
	</p>
	<p>Throughout my university projects and internship, I recognized a disconnect between understanding the science and understanding the software processes that drive that science forward. I decided to continue learning software engineering at Holberton Tulsa to be able to bridge the gap between science and software while engineering optimized processes. At Holberton Tulsa, I have been able to gain a technical foundation in low-level programming, higher-level object-oriented programming, and systems engineering/devops. I also have been able to work on hands-on projects and collaborate with peers daily, which has allowed me to see first-hand real-world experience of what it takes to work on a developer team. After finishing the foundational curriculum, I have chosen to specialize in Machine Learning. My favorite projects so far have focused on image analysis, building and training deep learning convolutional neural networks to classify images and start implementing object detection. I will be graduating from Holberton Tulsa in September 2021 and am hoping to join a collaborative team where I can apply my excitement for optics, data analysis, and machine learning to continuously optimize processes.

	  <h3>Optical Characterization and Comparison of Photolithography Process</h3>
	  <h4>Texas Instruments Process Engineer Intern  | Summer 2017</h4>
	  <p><a href="https://www.ti.com/">Texas Instruments</a> is a global semiconductor microchip manufacturer. One of the most crucial parts and the most common step in the semiconductor manufacturing process is photolithography.  During photolithography, a pattern is printed onto a semiconductor wafer to be used in other steps of building the integrated circuit.  This pattern is created by applying a light sensitive chemical layer to the chip, exposing it to light through a photomask, and developing the pattern by washing aways the parts of the layer made more soluable by the light exposure.  For more information about how microchips are made, including an overview of the photolithography process, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bor0qLifjz4">this video</a> made by Infineon Technologies.</p>
	  <p>As a Process Engineer in the Photolithography Manufacturing Department, I worked on three projects simultaneously to optimize processes.  My favorite project involved printing two wafers utilizing tool different exposure tools and performing optical characterization of 40+ unique structures within the patterns using a scanning electron microscope.  I then analyzed the critical measurements and visual analysis of these structures through focus for comparison.  The goal of this project was to determine if any adjustments needed to be made to the photomask for the new type of exposure tool to account for differing light diffraction.  If the patterns are similar and within normal target range, the process can be updated to utilize both the current type of exposure tool and the new type of exposure tool, reducing tool downtime and more efficienty printing this particular pattern.  I presented my results to the lead engineer of this pattern process and upper management of the smiconductor fab.  While further analysis needed to be obtained for structures in memory, when I left the internship, results looked promising to start implementing full-fabrication testing with the new type of exposure tool.</p>

	  <h3>Gamma Ray Attenuation Geometry Optimization</h3>
	  <h4>Colorado School of Mines Engineering Physics Senior Design  | Summer 2019</h4>
	  <p>I helped the Colorado School of Mines Physics Department improve their advanced lab radiation coursework through optimizing geometry to observe gamma ray attenuation.  I experimentally tested various geometries to determine the optimum position to observe gamma ray attenuation with new detector.  I managed and analyzed over 225 individual energy spectrums representing unique positions, absorber thicknesses, & radiation sources.  Then, I presented results to Physics Department Head to improve research.
